# TrinityWeb

Version: 3.0.4

TrinityWeb is a PHP web front-end management server forked from [MangosWeb Enhanced](https://sites.google.com/site/mwenhanced/).
Initially hosted on Google Code, and built on top of *MangosWeb*, the project has been left as-is since 2011.

The TrinityWeb fork will be compatible with more recent technologies like PHP 7.

UI refresh and new features are to be expected in the near future.

This README file is a work in progress. The original MangosWeb Extended [README.txt](README.txt) file can be found at the root of the project (for now).
